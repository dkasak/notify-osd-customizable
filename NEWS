This is the inital version of the new notification daemon "notify osd" developed
by Canonical's dx- and design-teams. It follows the freedesktop notification
specification and introduces some new policies for streamlining the user-
experience by discouraging the use of actions and timeouts. 

C-, Python- and C#-examples demonstrating correct usage of notifications have
been added. Have a look at the examples-directory. This accompanies the devel-
oper guidelines availabled under:
